Hello and welcome to {{ site.name }}!

![Mister F Avatar](/img/misterf-avatar.jpg)
{:class="avatar"}

I became a qualified teacher in 2019 and have gained lots of different experience in the education sector, including GCSE marking and private tuition. My speciality is Geography, however I share a passion for all Humanities subjects and English.

I am passionate about offering different services to 11--18 year olds, and I always offer a tailored service which fits around a student's strengths and weaknesses. I am really approachable and would love to help with your queries. I am based in West Yorkshire but I'm also happy to discuss remote tuition.

Please look at the services I offer and don't hesitate to contact me via the [contact page]({{ "/contact" | relative_url }}).

All the best,<br />
_Mr F._
